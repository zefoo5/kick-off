# kick-off
Hi 
I'm Ahmed (Zefoo is my nick name), pharmacist just quit my job in sales of medical devices. 10 years experience in sales
I found my passion in programming and joined zero-to-mastery 2018 course to be a web developer
I'm really excited and very eager to learn and very open to any help
Thanks
